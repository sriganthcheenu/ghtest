Git Config Reference:
- https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config

Git Repository:
- A repository is a folder that contains all of your project files and the entire revision history of those files.
- Git commands require you to be inside a Git repository to function properly.
- You can create a new Git repository using the command: `git init`.

Git add | Staging Changes:
- The `git add` command is used to stage changes in your working directory for the next commit.
- You can stage specific files using: `git add <file1> <file2>`.
- To stage all changes (new, modified, and deleted files), you can use: `git add .` or `git add -A`.

Git Commits | Code snapshots:
- A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time.
- Each commit has a unique identifier (SHA-1 hash | 40 characters) and contains metadata such as the author, date, and commit message.
- You can create a commit using the command: `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.

Git status | View changes:
- The `git status` command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area.
- It displays which files are staged for the next commit, which files have been modified, and which files are untracked.

Git log | View commit history:
- The `git log` command displays the commit history of the repository.
- You can see details such as commit hashes, authors, dates, and commit messages.

HEAD | Current commit:
- HEAD is a reference to the current commit in your repository.
- It typically points to the latest commit on the current branch.

Git checkout | Switch branches or restore files:
- The `git checkout` command is used to switch between branches or restore files to a specific state.
- To switch branches, use: `git checkout <branch-name>`.
- To restore a file to its last committed state, use: `git checkout -- <file-name>`.
- Git checkout <commit-hash> -- <file-name> will restore the specified file to its state in the given commit, 
  but it will be in a "detached HEAD" state, meaning you're not on any branch. To save changes, create a new branch from that state or switch back to an existing branch.


Git Revert | Undo changes:
- The `git revert` command is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made in a previous commit.
- It is a safe way to undo changes because it does not modify the existing commit history.
- It only reverts the changes introduced by the specified commit, leaving other commits intact.


Git Reset | Unstage or discard changes:
- The `git reset` command is used to unstage changes or discard commits.
- To unstage changes, use: `git reset <file-name>`.
- To discard commits and move the HEAD pointer back to a previous commit, use: `git reset --hard <commit-hash>`.
- It will remove all commits after the specified commit, so use it with caution.

.gitignore | Ignore files:
- The `.gitignore` file is used to specify files and directories that Git should ignore.

Git branches | Parallel versions of a repository:
- A branch is a separate line of development in a Git repository.
- You can create a new branch using the command: `git branch <branch-name>`.
- To switch to a different branch, use: `git checkout <branch-name>`.
- Branch name conventions: use lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_). Avoid spaces and special characters.
- You can also use / to create hierarchical branch names, e.g., `feature/login-page`.
- To delete a branch, use: `git branch -d <branch-name>`.


Git merge | Combine branches:
- The `git merge` command is used to combine changes from one branch into another.
- To merge a branch into the current branch, use: `git merge <branch-name>`.

Github:
- GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration features.
- You can create a new repository on GitHub and push your local Git repository to it using
- the command: `git remote add origin <repository-url>` followed by `git push -u origin main` (or the name of your branch) 'git pull origin main' to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository.
- GitHub also offers features like pull requests, issues, and project management tools to facilitate collaboration among developers.
- Types of GitHub repositories: Public (anyone can see) and Private (only you and collaborators can see).
- Adding remote repositories: `git remote add origin <repository-url>`.
- Pushing changes: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`.
- Set URL for remote repository: `git remote set-url origin <new-repository-url>`.
- Difference between git remote add and git remote set-url:
  - `git remote add` is used to add a new remote repository to your local Git repository. It establishes a connection between your local repository and the remote repository, allowing you to push and pull changes.
  - `git remote set-url` is used to change the URL of an existing remote repository. This is useful if the remote repository has moved to a new location or if you need to update the URL for any reason.
  - `git remote set-url origin https://<username>:<personal-access-token>@github.com/<username>/<repository>.git`
  - `git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>`: Sets the upstream (tracking) reference for the specified branch to the remote branch on the specified remote repository. This allows you to use git push and git pull without specifying the remote and branch names explicitly in future commands.
- Git pull | Fetch and merge changes:
  - The `git pull` command is used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local repository.    
  - To pull changes from the remote repository, use: `git pull origin <branch-name>`.
- Git fetch | Download changes:
  - The `git fetch` command is used to download changes from a remote repository without merging them into your local repository.
  - To fetch changes from the remote repository, use: `git fetch origin`.
- Git clone | Copy a repository:
  - The `git clone` command is used to create a copy of a remote Git repository on your local machine.
  - To clone a repository, use: `git clone <repository-url>`.
- GitHub Fork | Copy a repository to your account:
  - Forking a repository creates a personal copy of someone else's project on your GitHub account, allowing you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
  - To fork a repository, click the "Fork" button on the repository's GitHub page.

Github Repository README:
- A README file is a markdown file (README.md) that provides information about the project, such as its purpose, how to install and use it, and any other relevant details.

Github Pull Requests:
- A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository. It allows you to notify repository maintainers about changes you've made in your fork or branch, so they can review and potentially merge them into the main codebase.
- How to set pull request reviews:
  - Go to the repository on GitHub.
  - Click on the "Settings" tab.
  - In the left sidebar, click on "Branches".
  - Under "Branch protection rules", click on "Add rule" or select an existing rule to edit.
  - In the "Require pull request reviews before merging" section, check the box to enable it.
  - You can specify the number of required approvals and other settings as needed.
  - Click "Create" or "Save changes" to apply the settings.
- How to raise a pull request:
  - Fork the repository you want to contribute to.
  - Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
  - Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`.
  - Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`.
  - Push your changes to your forked repository: `git push origin my-feature-branch`.
  - Go to the original repository on GitHub and click on the "Pull requests" tab.
  - Click on the "New pull request" button.
  - Select your branch from the dropdown menu and provide a title and description for your pull request.
  - Click "Create pull request" to submit it for review.
